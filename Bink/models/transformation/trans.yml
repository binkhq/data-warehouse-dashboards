# Unlike staging, transformations are performed on already staged data and do not come
# directly from a source.
# All transformations are defined in a single trans.yml file.

# This example works out current sales statistics for each customer to suplement the
# customer data. Though this may be connected to the customer table as just another
# joining table, in this case it's not used.
